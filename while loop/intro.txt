total = 0
  while total < 100:
  num = int(input(“Enter a number: ”))
  total = total + num
print(“The total is”, total)
The above program will create a variable called total and store the
value as 0. It will ask the user to enter a number and will add it to
the total. It will keep repeating this as long as the total is still
below 100. When the total equals 100 or more, it will stop running
the loop and display the total.
